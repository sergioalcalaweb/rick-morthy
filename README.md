This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Rapid Component Development with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite

If you're looking to streamline your web development process, Tailwind CSS and Flowbite are two powerful tools that can significantly speed up component creation.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build flexible and responsive user interfaces with minimal custom CSS. It provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be applied directly to your HTML elements, making it easy to style your components.

## Flowbite for Component Generation

[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) is a fantastic resource that offers a collection of pre-designed, responsive components for web development. These components are built with Tailwind CSS in mind, which means they can seamlessly integrate into your Tailwind-based projects. Flowbite saves you time and effort by providing ready-made components like navigation bars, modals, cards, and more.
